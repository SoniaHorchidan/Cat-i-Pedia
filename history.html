	<div>
		<p>
			&emsp; Though every single cat is brilliant in their own right, some felines have found themselves in the most remarkable of situations and won the hearts of millions of people throughout the world. Not all of them became planetary famous because of their extraordinary deeds, but they all changed the way we perceive the feline universe.

			<h2>&emsp; Choupette Lagerfeld, the cat who is living the dream</h2>
			<p>
				&emsp; She is one of the most glamorous cats in the feline world, taking after her famous human, fashion rock star Karl Lagerfeld. The Chanel-loving cat won Lagerfeld's heart after staying with him for a couple of weeks when her first owner, model Baptiste Giabiconi, was abroad.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Inasmuch as the two formed an incredibly strong bond, Giabiconi gave her to Lagerfeld and the two have been inseparable ever since - the fashion legend even expressed a desire to marry Choupette, saying that he never thought he would fall in love like that in a cat. And he is not the only one who has been enchanted by the beautiful cat.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Choupette is also one of the most popular cats in the world, making millions of dollars every year and communicating with her fans via Twitter and Instagram. Spoiled as she is, Choupette loves extravagant fashion, using the Apple iPad, and eating at table with her beloved human. Moreover, she has two maids who tend to her every need and even keep a diary of her daily activities.

			<h2>&emsp; Maru, the cat who rules the internet</h2>
			<p>
				&emsp; Keeping in mind that the Internet is made of cats, becoming the most popular cat on the web is not an easy achievement. Though millions of felines have competed for supremacy over the network of networks, only one cat can boast the title of the most famous cat on the Internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Maru is an adorable Scottish Fold who became worldwide popular as the cat who loves nothing more than to jump into small boxes and sleep in big boxes. Even though many would regard this behavior as typical cat behavior, Maru was the one who managed to become a celebrity thanks to her owner and YouTube – apart from making money from YouTube advertisements, he is no stranger to bringing home the bacon offline, having published two books and DVDs.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Unaware of his fame and fortune, Maru continues to play in cardboard boxes and sweep the Internet community off its feet.

			<h2>&emsp; Tommaso, the richest cat in the world</h2>
			<p>
				&emsp; Tommaso is the protagonist of one of the most incredible rags-to-riches stories of all time. Once a poor stray roaming the streets of the Eternal City, Tommaso is a black feline whose world turned upside down when a wealthy lady found him and decided to give him a forever home.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Apart from providing him a roof over his head, Maria Assunta loved him dearly and made sure he had everything a feline could ever possibly need in this world. And more, much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Assunta's late husband left his widow a fortune, and since the couple had no children (or close relatives, for that matter), the elderly lade named Tommaso as the only heir to her estate. When the 94-year-old woman died, her beloved cat inherited a whopping $10 million and officially became the world's richest cat and one of the wealthiest pets ever.

			<h2>&emsp; Tabby, the first presidential cat</h2>
			<p>
				&emsp;Abraham Lincoln went down in history as one of the most popular U.S. presidents and his precious cat became forever known as the first cat ever to roam the White House. Though we have always been aware that President Lincoln changed our world for the better, not many people are familiar with his great love for all living creatures, animals included.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp;That being said, it doesn’t come as a surprise that he had many pets during his lifetime, the most famous being his two felines Tabby and Dixies. Before relocating to Washington D.C., Lincoln’s son Tad asked his father whether it would be possible to bring their cat Tabby along with them and Lincoln said it would be a wonderful idea to have a feline companion in the White House.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp;Consequently, Lincoln became the first President of the United States to bring a cat to the presidential residence, quickly adopting another feline named Dixie. Though Tabby was his favorite pet cat, Dixie also had a special place in his heart and he was even quoted to have said that Dixie is cleverer than his entire cabinet.
